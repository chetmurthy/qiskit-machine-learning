deprecations:
  - |
    For the class :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel`, to
    improve usability and better describe the usage, ``user_parameters`` has been
    renamed to ``training_parameters``; current behavior is retained. For this
    change the constructor parameter ``user_parameters`` is now deprecated and
    replaced by ``training_parameters``. The related properties and methods are
    renamed to match. Thus the properties ``user_parameters`` and ``user_param_binds`
    are both deprecated and replaced by ``training_parameters`` and
    ``training_param_binds`` respectively. The methods ``assign_user_parameters``,
    ``bind_user_parameters`` and ``get_unbound_user_parameters`` are deprecated and
    replaced by ``assign_training_parameters``, ``bind_training_parameters`` and
    ``get_unbound_training_parameters``.
